## Manoa Class Planner

*This idea was created by Olivia Murray, Collin Takasaki, and Riley Cammack*

*The problem:* For many UH students, scheduling the next semester can be hard. You have to figure out what classes you have to take, want to take, and what is available. On top of that, you want a good professor.  What usually ends up happening is a student has a bunch of tabs open and takes much longer than needed.

*The solution:* The Manoa Class Planner (MCP) web application provides a whole new way to schedule classes. You can search for courses by subject. MCP uses the class availability for the upcoming semester to show what courses are available, very similar to the UH class availability website. However, if you click on a certain class, a drop-down will appear with a course description, the professor, the professor's overall RateMyProfessor rating with the link, and the final exam date and time.
