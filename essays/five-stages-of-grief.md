#5 Stages of Grief#

Everyone is always going on about a ‘hot new thing’ or the ‘next big thing’ “that will change the way we ______  _______”.  Over the years, I’ve become very skeptic about all of these things.  After a few iterations of Windows that have been… less than ideal, I’ve learned to give the ‘next big thing’ a few months before checking back on it.  

Currently I’ve been forced to use Semantic UI, which has been around for a while.  However, as an open source project, it still has an ongoing ‘new’ feeling as it’s perpetually updated.  I can imagine the developers of Semantic UI bringing one feature to fruition before immediately jumping to the next.  Unfortunately, it also feels as though, in order to still keep that ‘new’ awesome feeling, the developers have either forgotten or overlooked the need to upgrade their documentation as well.  These issues have caused me some grief.

#Denial - “It’s not here? It has to be here. I just need to look harder.”#

Two of the issues that I ran into were trying to find information dealing with the menus and colors in Semantic UI.  For the menus, I was searching for the code needed to make a dropdown menu function.  For the colors, I was searching for a way to override the colors that Semantic UI had already declared.  For both of these, I was unable to find the code needed, though the documentation did allude to the fact that both were possible (for the dropdown menu, the documentation did mention that JavaScript was necessary).

#Anger - “You just mentioned it! Where is it?!”#

In both of the previously mentioned cases, I kept ending up at the same place.  The pages (and sections) that alluded to the possibility of what I wanted, but not the method.  Once was slightly annoying, half a dozen times was starting to make me lose my head.

#Bargaining - “I’ll just search one more place, and I’ll find what I need. Just one more.”#

After walking away from my computer to let my head cool down, I came back with a different approach.  If the documentation didn’t have it, then check the user forums.  The forums should have information that the documentation may have missed.  

#Depression - “What do you mean there’s only 50 entries involving ‘menu’ on the User Forums?”#

Needless to say, that was not the case.  The threads on the forums were limited at best, with a large portion of them having no answers to the initial post.  I felt like giving up, throwing the project into the trash bin, and calling it a night.  

#Acceptance#

Before hitting the delete button, I just took a minute to look at the current status of my project.  It wasn’t what I wanted it to be… but it was something.  If, at the very least, it got some points for effort and attempts at coding in Semantic UI, then at least the time spent stress searching through the documentation would have some worth.  With that I finished a portion more (with Semantic UI classes I could already utilize) and sent it in.

For me, Semantic UI feels, in a word, clunky.  Semantic UI is meant as a quick functional language to make a website presentable.  However, the lack of thorough documentation creates a steep learning curve.  If you can brute force your way passed the learning curve you will see that although it isn’t meant to make the most high tech, flashy, over-the-top sites, it does fill it’s niche well.  The more advanced options might change my mind on this, but with how the documentation is for the more basic elements, I think I’ll keep my distance from those for now.
