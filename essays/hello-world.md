It has only been a few weeks after I’ve been introduced to JavaScript.  The journey so far hasn’t been difficult, but I’m starting to wonder if that could be an issue.  It feels like I haven’t been exposed to enough of JavaScript to create an adequate response to the language. However, I can at least go over the little that I have experienced.

So far our class has gone through a tutorial on JavaScript, learning the standard syntax and basic functionality.  It felt like that tutorial was created to feel similar to other languages though, since to me it seemed very close to all of the syntax I would use in C++.  The main differences that I noticed from the tutorial were the “var” declaration and the ways to access data in an object.  With JavaScript, the type declarations have all been replaced by “var” (or by “let”), meaning that the variables made are dynamic, able to change from an int or float to a string as needed.  As for the objects in JavaScript, they are very different from the ones I’ve used in C++.  The arrays in JavaScript act as vectors, being able to “push” and “pop” (“shift”), and although they can be accessed with dot notation like C++, they can also be accessed like a map.

Although these differences make JavaScript can be useful, I’m not sure whether it’s necessary.  While the objects in JavaScript are different, there are similar things in other languages. To me, it feels like a “shiny new toy” but it doesn’t feel like it will revolutionize how I use objects.  The dynamic data type of JavaScript, however, can be used in a variety of cases, allowing the user to not worry about using the right data type and being a godsend when the inputs could be anything.  While I can see this being very useful in many cases, is it vital?  There is a work around in C++ if I take in all inputs as a string and convert them as necessary, and I believe Python also has its own dynamic variable, so what makes JavaScript unique?

This is the reason why it feels like I haven’t understood JavaScript yet.  All that I can say for sure right now is that, “I know nothing”, but by the end of this course I’m hoping to say “I know something”.
