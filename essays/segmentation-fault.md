Throughout my time in the Computer Engineering department, (Stack Overflow)[https://stackoverflow.com/] has been a constant resource.  The forum helped me understand concepts that were mentioned throughout my object-oriented programming course.  It also helped me to understand pieces of code that were present in my Sophmore project, such as hash-maps, sockets, and ports.  Everytime I saw a Stack Overflow result from a Google search, I knew that there would be a good explanation for the topic.  In the case where the explanation wasn't the answer I needed, it would at least give me enough information to ask a better question.

Recently though, I was in a situation where I "knew" what was wrong and asked for help from an expert.  After setting up an appointment for later in the day, I questioned the issue: "What was the problem?", "What have I tried?", "What were my results?", and most importantly "Does my conclusion make the most sense?".  Twenty minutes later I had cancelled the appointment because my issue had been resolved quite easily.  The main problem was that I didn't want to think through the entire situation and really examine what was really happening.  Looking through the depths of Stack Overflow show that I'm not the only one who asks for help before they completely examine the situation.  

Searching the numerous downvoted questions of Stack Overflow brought up some especially lazy questions.
