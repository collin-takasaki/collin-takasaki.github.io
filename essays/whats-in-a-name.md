In the Fall of 2017, I found a sophomore project at HSFL.  They had me use the COSMOS program that they had developed and find out it how compatible it was with another open source program to create a web-browser interface for COSMOS.  Though the documentation on COSMOS didn’t cover much of its protocols and other inner workings, the style of coding used made it possible to understand new concepts through reading the code. 

In Spring 2017, I took Object-Oriented Programming in C++.  Throughout the exams and quizzes we had, I would always draw a blank on what to name my variables, and would inevitably revert to single character names.  Although the functions would “work”, they weren’t anything I would currently consider as “readable”.  It wasn’t until I worked with COSMOS that I began to put any effort into the readability of the code I created.  

In the COSMOS code, just about everything has meaningful information.  Function declarations have a general description of their functionality as well their arguments.  Variable names give a basic idea of how they’re used or what kinds of information they contain.  All of it is very deliberate and essential in order to manage the large amount of code.  By just tracing the code and reading the comments, I learned about different concepts, such as hashmaps, enum, and sockets. 

After working with COSMOS’ code, I began to focus a bit more on readability.  It began with variable names (though I will still give a generic name to a variable when I draw a blank on a meaningful name) and adding more comments into my code.  Currently, I believe that the readability of my code has gone up, but there is still much work that could be done. For example, though I try to maintain proper indents and spacing around variables, there are many times in coding assignments I think, “I don’t have time for this”, and just forgo the extra space or two.  For small coding assignments, this probably isn’t going to make much of a difference, however, for a significantly large project, the extra space or two is the difference between being able to search for “ someClass “ while ignoring every instance of “someClass.variableName”.
