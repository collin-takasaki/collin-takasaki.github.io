summary: I updated the documentation of COSMOS for the wiki hosted on Bitbucket.
---

During my internship with [Hawaii Space Flight Laboratory (HSFL)](https://www.hsfl.hawaii.edu/) during the summer of 2017, I was given the task of updating the documentation of the COSMOS program.  This required me to consolidate the data from multiple locations into a new location (the Bitbucket wiki page of the project), go through the tutorials to install and build COSMOS, as well as record and troubleshoot any issues that I encountered. I also added images to assist new users in the installation process for the various OS's including the setup of git clients such as GitKraken and SourceTree.  In the process of building up the wiki, I learned the markdown notation that Bitbucket utilized in order to make the pages more functional.

Unfortunately, the repositories have been moved during the fall, rendering the links obsolete.
