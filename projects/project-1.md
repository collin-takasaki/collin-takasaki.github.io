During my internship with Hawaii Space Flight Labs (HSFL) during the summer of 2017, I was given the task of updating the documentation of the COSMOS program.  This required me to consolidate the data from multiple locations into a new location (the Bitbucket wiki page of the project), go through the tutorials to get COSMOS built, as well as record and troubleshoot any issues that I found. I also added images to assist new users in the installation process for the various OS's.  In the process of building up the wiki, I learned the markdown notation that Bitbucket utilized in order to make the pages more functional.
